Lorem ipsum how to handle a SYNCRONIZATION ISSUE?
            SYNCRONIZATION IS MAKING SURE OUR DRIVER AND BROWSER ARE ON THE SAME PAGE
            SINCE SELENIUM BROWSER DRIVER IS ALOT FASTER COMPARED TO THE BROWSERS , WE USED
             DIFFERENT TYPE OF WAITS TO MAKE SURE SELENIUM IS SYNCHRONIZED WITH BROWSERS


            WHEN WE LOAD A WEB PAGE SO THERE IS A SOME LOADING TIME IN THAT AND WE HAVE TO WAIT
            FOR THAT PARTICULAR TIME
            IF YOU CLICK SOMETHING BUT THE ELEMENT IS NOT YET LOADED ,IT WOULD THROW AND EXCEPTION
